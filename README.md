# bcryptjs-webcrypto
This is a fork of [bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js).  
This adapted for WebCrypto environments such as Cloudflare Workers and modern browsers.  
Compatibility with Node.js has been deliberately removed to improve purity and avoid the injection of polyfills. 

Usage and other information are available in the original.  
Please see [bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js).

## Install
```bash
$ bun install bcryptjs-webcrypto
```
